This directory will temporarily contain all JappeOS x86_64 binaries including the desktop environment and login screen. They will be later moved to packages managed by a package manager for updates etc. The binaries in this folder are just random ones built off of random commits, but not gitignored for ease-of-use purposes.

The binaries are:
- `desktop` (`jappeos_desktop`)
- `greeter` (`jappeos_greeter`)
- `jappeos_core`
